    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
        <br><br>Shut in his cold drafty basement stood Professor Elkleridge.
        <br>Professor Elkleridge was having a very difficult time remembering how he came to be back in his basement.
        <br>"OK, Stanley. Let's think this through" the weary academic stammers to himself.
        <br>The last thing he remembered was walking through the woods behind the manor with his dog, Persimmon, at dusk.
